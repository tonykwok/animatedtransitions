  <p>
  This library, documented in Chapter 18 of the book
 <a href="http://filthyrichclients.org">Filthy Rich Clients</a>,
enables easy, automated transitions between different
  UI screens of an application. The library works by creating and 
configuring a <code>ScreenTransition</code> object, starting it
when you want to run the transition, handling a single callback
to an implementation of <code>TransitionTarget.setupNextScreen()</code>,
and letting the library do everything else.
</p>
<p>
The library figures out which components change
between the before/after screens and then automatically runs
animated effects for all of those changing components.
Which effects are run depends on how the components change
and whether there are any custom effects installed in the
system.
</p>
<p>
There is obviously a lot more to it, but I will leave the explanation
of how it all works to the book, articles, and demos referenced
in the <a href="Resources">Resources</a> section below.

<b>October 26, 2007</b>: Release 0.11
</p>
<p>
    Minor but important change (to me, at least); I removed the internal
    hack that required applets/applications to be signed. Basically, the
    library was using reflection to set an internal property inside of
    JComponent that disabled double-buffering when rendering transition
    components to images. There was a better workaround available that
    required no such hack, so I've changed the code and it is no longer
    necessary go sign your apps, at least not because of AnimatedTransitions.
</p>
<p>
<b>October 22, 2007</b>: Release 0.1 debuted!
</p>
<p>
This is the first source release. It's nearly the same API as in
<a href="http://filthyrichclients.org">the book</a> (changes
are documented on the book's website's "Errata" page), although
there have been some important performance and leak fixes since
the initial demos were released.
</p>
<h2>
<a name="Limitations">Limitations</a>
</h2>
<p>
    As of October 22, 2007:
    </p>
    <p>
The library is, I subjectively think, a pretty cool utility for
making screen transtions wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy way
easier than they are if you're simply hand-coding all of the
animations. However, there are rough edges to the API and
the implementation that are worth noting. Think of these 
as notes on what to expect, what not to expect, and what
I hope to work on in future releases.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>API</b>: There are a lot of methods that shouldn't be public, 
but which happen to be just because of how the packages are 
currently structured. This should be fixed soon. The actual
API that you should use is actually quite small. The API
that custom effect developers use is slightly larger. But
the API exposed in the JavaDocs is larger than it needs to
be, and makes the API seem more confusing than it actually is.
</li>
<li><b>Toplevel components only</b>: One of the core restrictions of
the library right now is that it only monitors the existence
and state of components at the top level of the transition
container. So, for example, it knows if a button (that is
a direct child of the transition container) appears, 
disappears, or changes location/size between screens. But
it doesn't know whether a JList changed the number of items
between screens. This makes the library unsuitable for
transitioning between components that change internal state
between screens.<br />
This is a pretty important transition to handle; it's just
one that the library does not solve. Yet. I would like to
address that problem eventually (hint: it's not an easy
one. Or at least no easy solution has occurred to me. Yet.)
</li>
<li><b>First transition startup performance</b>: Various performance
issues have been addressed since the book demos first came
out, but that first transition still has more of a hiccup than
it should. The system is setting up various data structures, 
images, and other things the first time that simply take
time. But there has to be a better way to do it, so that the
first transition is completely smooth. Gotta fix this.
</li>
<li><b>Only size/location tracked</b>: The only state tracked as 
changing between screens is size and location of components.
Ideally, there would be more state tracked, or some way to
track arbitrary state changes (such as something that an
app could plug into). Or maybe an app should be able to specify
that a component is changing, even though it doesn't look like
it to the animtrans library. In any case, this is a limitation
of the assumptions that the library currently makes.
</li>
<li><b>Various inefficiencies and cleanup TODOs</b>: There are various
ways of doing things internally that could be improved, such
as how and when snapshot images of components are taken and
used, how it is determined whether to redraw components
(versus showing snapshot images), and so on. The library just
needs some quality care now that it's out there being seen for
the first time. It's passed the first hurdle of becoming
useful; now it needs to become more robust and clean.
